        ## Muse
        Muse is a collaborative idea-sharing platform where users can store, discover, and share short, spontaneous
        thoughts. Designed to be fast, minimal, and inspiring, Muse helps creators capture ideas in the moment—and
        browse others’ thoughts to spark new ones. Whether you're brainstorming, planning, or daydreaming, Muse gives
        your ideas a home.

        ### Features
        Muse allows for fast idea capture, enabling users to submit short ideas instantly with a title, category, and
        timestamp. Ideas can be explored either by tag or by time, allowing users to filter ideas by category or browse
        by date to revisit past inspiration. If you’re feeling stuck, Muse provides a random idea generator to serve you
        a random thought from the vault. Additionally, the public idea board lets you see what others are thinking,
        creating a shared mental playground where creativity can flow freely. The platform’s backend is lightweight,
        built with Go and using `net/http` and `encoding/json` for both speed and simplicity. The frontend is minimal,
        built with Next.js to offer a fast, responsive, and clean user interface.

        ### Installation
        To run Muse locally, start by cloning the monorepo:

        git clone https://github.com/egeuysall/muse.git
        cd muse

        Next, navigate to each project folder and install dependencies. For the frontend, go to the frontend directory
        and run:
        cd frontend
        pnpm install
        pnpm dev

        For the backend, switch to the backend folder and run:
        cd ../backend
        go run main.go

        Once everything is set up, you can access the frontend at http://localhost:3000 and ensure that the backend is
        running on http://localhost:8080.

        ### Technologies Used
        Muse’s backend is built using Go (Golang), taking advantage of its speed and reliability with the standard
        library. The frontend is developed with Next.js 15, a React framework that incorporates the App Router to
        optimize performance. TypeScript is used to ensure safe and structured development on the frontend. The design
        of Muse is minimal and responsive, thanks to the use of Tailwind CSS. For package management, pnpm is employed
        for its speed and disk efficiency.

        ### Environment Variables
        To run the application, create a .env.local file in both the frontend and backend directories and populate it
        with the appropriate environment variables.

        ### Development
        Muse is structured as a monorepo with the frontend as a Next.js app and the backend as a Go server. Make sure to
        follow standard linting and formatting practices before committing any changes.
